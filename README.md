# postage-rs
Postage is a Rust library that provides a rich set of channels for use in async applications.

Postage provides a Stream trait, which includes combinators such as Map, Filter, etc, as well as a Sink trait with similar combinators.

Postage is in *alpha* quality and is currently unstable as I work on the API.
